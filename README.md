# Shattered Pixel Dungeon seed explorer

This is a mod that adds a few tweaks to make seed hunting for the game Shattered Pixel Dungeon easier:
 - the hero will be able to see every tile and item of the current floor
 - every item found will be spawned already identified
 - the cloak of shadows will never run out of charges
 - the hero won't take any damage

Moreover at the start of every adventure, you will be given the following items:
 - a modified version of ethereal chains with a shortened animation, infinite reach and able to reach tiles not adjacent to walls
 - a scroll of awareness, which will list all the quest rewards (if there is any at your current depth) and all generated items on the floor by category (excluding keys, money stashes and dewdrops)
 - an overpowered weapon that is able to kill most enemies in 1 or 2 hits
